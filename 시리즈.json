One day, Soo Ho suddenly rushes into a female dormitory covered in blood, and Eun Young Cho hides him and tends to his wounds despite facing danger under close surveillance. Among those monitoring, Soo Ho and Young Cho must avoid Pi Seung Hee, the notoriously strict and imposing housemother of Young Cho's dorm, and Kye Boon Ok, a phone operator at the dorm who had to forgo a college education due to her familyâ€™s financial circumstances.
